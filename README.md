# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Answers
Solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms challenges from LeetCode, HackerRank, and StrataScratch. Each solution is organized by topic (e.g., arrays, linked lists) and some have test cases, serving as a reference for learning and interview prep. I did all of the problems in Python.
Here is a link to my Leetcode(I have also SQL problems there done in MySQL/PostgreSQL) - https://leetcode.com/u/CrisuJ/
