# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Answers
Solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms challenges from LeetCode, HackerRank, and StrataScratch. Each solution is organized by topic (e.g., arrays, linked lists) with explanations and test cases, serving as a reference for learning and interview prep. I did all of the problems in Python, in every file there is description from LeetCode and link to a problem
